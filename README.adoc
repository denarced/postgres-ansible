= postgres-ansible

An example playbook to setup PostgreSQL database server on Ubuntu 14.04. There's
also a Vagrantfile that'll setup the Ubuntu virtual machine and execute the
Ansible playbook on it.

== Why?

For the beginners this is a good template but there's also the part about
setting up a locale before installing PostgreSQL that's not obvious.

== Requirements

I developed this on Ubuntu 16.04 and the following were installed:

- Ansible 2.1.1.0
- Vagrant 1.8.1

Ansible was installed according to
http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_installation.html#latest-releases-via-apt-ubuntu[official
instructions]:
```
sudo apt-add-repository ppa:ansible/ansible
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ansible
```

Vagrant from the Ubuntu repos:
```
sudo apt install vagrant
```

== Setup

Just clone this repo and execute `vagrant up`.
